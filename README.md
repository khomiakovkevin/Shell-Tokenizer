# Shell-Tokenizer
A hardcoded version of Shell Tokenizer

My shell tokenizer reads single line shell commands, splits them into a sequence of tokens, reverses the sequence, and prints out one token per line
There are three kinds of tokens: Command names, Command arguments, Shell operators. Spaces that appear in a command are not tokens, although they may separate tokens.
